# Implementing a Bootloader from Scratch

Since my childhood, seeing that black-screen during boot process was really freaky for me. That's why I decided to use a manual (Writing a Simple Operating System from Scratch, which you can find under `Books/`) and Qemu emulator to write a very simplistic bootloader.

I highly recommend you to read this manual and try to implement each milestone on your own. This repository should play the role of a solution reference, in case you get stuck.
